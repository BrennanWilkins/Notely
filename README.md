# Notely

Notely is inspired by Evernote, with notebooks, notes, and productivity tools to stay productive and have all of your notes and ideas in one place.

The rich text editor gives you all of the features you would need in a text editor like font styles, font sizes, aligning text, font colors, and more.

Your changes to your notes are updated every second, so saving your notes is not needed.
